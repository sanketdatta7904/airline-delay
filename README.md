# Aviation Data for Research
Sanket Datta, Jonathan Rentschler, and Almaz Baghirova

### DATA
aviation db
https://cloud.uni-konstanz.de/index.php/s/DFdDdKQ7P6pfAJ3

### TECHNICAL COMPONENTS
To get the project up and running, make sure to
* make sure the database is connected
* Approach 1 (db file) 
    * Download the `aviation.db` file (https://cloud.uni-konstanz.de/index.php/s/DFdDdKQ7P6pfAJ3)
    * locate it in the parent of the git repository.
        e.g. if the git repository is installed in `C:\git\dbvis\group-2`, make sure to put the db file in `C:\git\dbvis`
        this is done so that the db file won't accidentally be added to git
* Approach 2 (sql dump) 
    * // todo @Sankett
* Open the group-2 Unity project with the editor version 2022.3.12f1
* After loading you will see an empty scene
* Navigate to the folder `Assets/Scenes/` and open the scene called main_scene
